Description: Provides half-normal plots, reference plots, and Pareto plots
    of effects from an unreplicated experiment, along with various 
    pseudo-standard-error measures, simulated reference distributions, 
    and other tools. Many of these methods are described in 
    Daniel C. (1959) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1959.10489866> and/or
    Lenth R.V. (1989) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1989.10488595>, but some new
    approaches are added and integrated in one package.
